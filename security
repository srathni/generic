Security & Access Control
Ensuring the security and integrity of data throughout the ETL pipeline is paramount. The framework implements a series of security measures to control access, protect sensitive data, and ensure that operations are conducted in a compliant manner.

1. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication: The ETL framework integrates with the organization's existing identity and access management (IAM) system (e.g., LDAP, OAuth, or Active Directory) for user authentication.
Authorization: User roles and permissions are defined in a centralized access control system. Roles are assigned based on responsibility, and permissions are scoped to specific batches, tables, or actions (read/write/execute).
Admins: Full access to batch execution, rule management, and data sources.
Data Engineers: Access to create and modify batches and rules but restricted from certain system-wide operations.
Viewers: Read-only access to monitor batch statuses, logs, and metrics.
2. Data Encryption

In Transit: All data exchanged between the Spark engine and external systems (e.g., databases, data lakes, Kafka) is encrypted using industry-standard protocols such as TLS/SSL.
At Rest: Data stored in S3, HDFS, or any other data store is encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent encryption standards. Key management is handled via a secure key management service (KMS).
3. Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logging is implemented to track:
User actions (e.g., initiating a batch, modifying rules)
Data access patterns (e.g., read/write operations on sensitive data)
System-level changes (e.g., upgrades, configuration changes)
Audit logs are stored securely and can be accessed only by authorized personnel.

4. Sensitive Data Handling

Data Masking: Sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information, financial data) is masked or obfuscated when read from or written to source or destination systems.
Access Control on Sensitive Columns: Additional row-level security is implemented to ensure that sensitive data is only accessible by users with the appropriate clearance.
Data Anonymization: Where applicable, data anonymization techniques are applied to ensure that even if data is accessed without authorization, it cannot be linked back to individuals or sensitive entities.
5. Secure API Access

All APIs exposed by the framework (for logging, monitoring, batch control, etc.) require API keys or OAuth tokens for access. These APIs are protected with rate limiting and IP whitelisting to prevent abuse.
6. Compliance & Regulatory Requirements

The framework is designed to meet industry-specific security and compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2). Periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted to ensure ongoing compliance.
