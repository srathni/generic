This year, I led the development of a new PySpark-based data pipeline framework designed to replace a legacy ETL solution. The focus was on building a scalable, maintainable, and extensible system from the ground up — one that can adapt to evolving data needs with minimal disruption.

A key achievement was implementing a configuration-driven approach, where execution logic is fully controlled by metadata. This empowers teams to onboard new rules and workflows quickly, without modifying the core codebase — significantly improving agility and reducing time-to-production for new use cases.

The framework adheres to clean code architecture principles and emphasizes modularity, with clear boundaries and separation of concerns. Each component is responsible for a single, well-defined task, making the system open to extension without impacting existing logic. This ensures new functionality can be introduced safely and with confidence.

This work reflects my strengths in backend engineering, system design, and clean code practices, and has laid a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and cost-efficient data pipeline ecosystem. By prioritizing clarity, reusability, and extensibility, the framework positions the team for long-term success and operational stability.
